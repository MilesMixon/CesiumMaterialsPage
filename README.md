For this project you need to have express installed for it to run. To install express open a command prompt and type
"npm install express". From there type "node material_server.js" to run the Node.js server and get functionality for the 
webpage. The server runs off localhost, and the index page in this case is Matrials.html.

Type "http://localhost:8080/Materials.html" after node is running to see the page. 

Due to the time constraints I was not able to style the page like the mockup and was not able to completely debug the 
page. As the page is currently, the user must refocus an material after every change to change or update before they
make another one. Any changes made without refocusing the elements will not stick.

For this project I focused on the functionality of the project. I was unable to make unit tests and was unable to style the
page due to being focused on making it work. I spent 3 hours creating the project and spent an extra 1-2 testing and debugging.
